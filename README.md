# Lung Disease Recognition Using Audio Analysis with ML

## Overview
- **Objective**: Utilize machine learning to analyze audio data for lung disease recognition.
- **Methodology**: Implement audio processing techniques and ML algorithms to identify patterns indicative of lung diseases.

## Installation
- **Requirements**: List the necessary libraries and dependencies for the project.Please follow the "requiremnets.txt" file for installing neccessary packages.
- **Setup**: Provide step-by-step instructions for setting up the project environment.

## Usage
- **Data Preparation**: To prepare audio data for analysis, the process typically involves collecting respiratory sound datasets, converting the audio files into a suitable format for processing, and then extracting relevant features that can be used for machine learning. This may include techniques like Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Mel Frequency Ceptral Coeffiencients (MFCC)to analyze the frequency components of the sounds.
- **Model Training**: Training the machine learning model involves using the prepared data to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Self Improved Optimization Tecnique (SIO). The CNN will learn to recognize patterns and features in the audio data that are indicative of various lung diseases. The training process includes feeding the data into the CNN, adjusting the model parameters, and optimizing the algorithm to improve accuracy.
- **Prediction**: Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new audio data. This involves inputting the audio files into the CNN, which then processes the data and provides a prediction based on the learned patterns. The prediction might indicate the presence or absence of a pulmonary disease, or classify the type of condition detected in the respiratory sounds.
